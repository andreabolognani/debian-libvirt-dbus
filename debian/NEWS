libvirt-dbus (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The user "libvirtdbus" is now added to group "libvirt" on install/upgrade.

  This group is only used to manage libvirt socket access and libvirt-dbus
  needs to be able to connect there (In Debian via a policykit rule in
  /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/60-libvirt.pkla and in Ubuntu
  directly on the socket permissions).
