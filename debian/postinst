        # Debian, like upstream, uses policykit to control access to libvirt:
        # specifically, /run/libvirt/libvirt-sock has ownership root:root and
        # permissions 666, but the policy defined in
        # /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/libvirt-dbus.rules prevents users other
        # than those in the libvirt group to actually perform management
        # operations.
        #
        # Ubuntu doesn't use policykit for this, and relies on standard Unix
        # permissions instead: specifically, the socket has ownership
        # root:libvirt and permissions 660.
        #
        # The end result is the same, in that only root and users that are in
        # the libvirt group can perform privileged operations.
        #
        # For libvirt-dbus to work, the libvirtdbus user that the daemon runs
        # as needs to be able to open a privileged connection to libvirt.
        #
        # Once again, Debian achieves this through policykit by installing a
        # special rule, whereas Ubuntu needs to add the user to the libvirt
        # group, which is what we do here. Note that the user is only added to
        # the group on fresh installs or upgrades from old versions of
        # libvirt-dbus, because we don't want to accidentally override local
        # changes to group membership.
